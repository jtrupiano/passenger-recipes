== DESCRIPTION:
This gem provides a set of recipes for deploying with Passenger.  It's much
more restrictive than Capistrano in the sense that it 'locks down' some 
aspects of what Capistrano actually allows.  See the FEATURES section
below for more specific details.

== INCOMPLETE ==
* Missing a detailed sample config file
* This README is still quite sparse-- add in summaries for each new task
* Describe changes to default deploy recipes
* Discuss dependencies a bit more
* Implement OS-specific default values (Ubuntu and CentOS at a minimum)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Enforces non-root deployment.  The deploy:setup task does not actually 
  execute anything, but rather outputs the a set of instructions for you 
  to manually execute.  The reason for this is that certain aspects of 
  setting up a server require root access.  Incremental deployment, by 
  contrast, does not require this level of privilege.  As such, we 
  recommend that you take care of setting up your server by yourself.
  
  Note: to "lift" this restriction, you can simply override the 
  :ensure_not_root function.  However, this is not recommended, 
  considering Apache needs to own all of your files.  e.g.
  
  def ensure_not_root; end

* Enforces that Chad Wooley's GemInstaller gem is installed on the
  server.  It *****

* NEW PROPERTIES --> DEFAULTS
  # Where is the apache config snippet 
  :apache_conf --> {"#{latest_release}/config/#{rails_env}/apache.conf"}

  # Which group does apache run as
  :apache_group --> www-data
  
  # Full path to the graceful restart command of apache
  :apache_restart_cmd --> /usr/sbin/apache2ctl
